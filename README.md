# tKinterEverything
Hoping to develop a general tKinter template that covers any use case. 

Inputs and widgets are divided into tabs to organize them into categories. You can hopefully take a tab or multiple, and assort inputs into it however you like and nix the rest. I hope this can help some people, and please do make merge requests to enhance the template! I'm keeping it as simple as possible while maximizing its features.

Don't forget you can compile a python script as an executable via pyinstaller (e.g. pyinstaller tKinterEverything.py --onefile --noconsole)
